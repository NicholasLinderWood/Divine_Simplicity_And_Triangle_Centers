# Divine_Simplicity_And_Triangle_Centers

This repository contains two python files and a PDF:

Geometry.py - A library containing class definitions for Triangle_Viewer. Don't touch this one.

Triangle_Viewer.py - A script that runs an interactive triangle viewer. Run and enjoy!

Divine Simplicity and Triangle Centers.pdf - A write-up explaining the doctrine of divine simplicity and the analogy between it and triangle centers.

The purpose of these files is to explore an analogy for a complicated doctrine in Catholicism called "Divine Simplicity" and triangle centers. I hope you enjoy!
